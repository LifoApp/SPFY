explicitly list any and all resources necessary for the completion of
the Safe Place for Youth database as described in the [Requirements
Specification](https://github.com/SirSeim/SPFY/blob/master/docs/Requirements_Specification.md).
The Software Development Plan will also provide a timeline of events
that must be completed in the appropriate order. A GANTT chart will
detail this timeline.

##4.3 Project Organization

###4.3.1 Organization Structure

The project demands integration between database, front end, and back
end. Because of this, the organization of our teams follows each
concept. There are three teams, one for each division, and Chris Franco
manages overall compatibility and success.

###4.3.2 External Interfaces

Chris, the project instigator, is the main connection to SPY. He has set
up communicative applications to allow SPY staff to access our team
discussions and decisions. Additionally, our team records and outlines
our in-person meetings.

###4.3.3 Roles and Responsibilities

Each week the development team meets 6-7:30 on Friday evenings. On
Mondays, the development team meets with SPY staff at 3:30 to
demonstrate current functionality and discuss dream-design.
